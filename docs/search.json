    "text": "Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and widely known Machine Learning Algorithms which people start with. Building blocks of a Linear Regression Model are:\n\nDependent Variable: The main factor in Linear Regression. It is the variable that we want to predict or forecast.\nIndependent Variables: These variables are the factors that we hypothesize have an impact on our dependent variable.\n\n\n\nLinear Regression is based on the equation of a straight line, y = mx + c, where y is the dependent variable we want to predict, x is the independent variable we use to make the prediction, m is the slope of the line, and c is the y-intercept.\nIn a machine learning context, y is often called the target or label, and x is called a feature. The terms m and c are parameters of the model that are learned from the training data.\n\n\n\nLinear regression is easy to understand and explain, making it a popular tool for business analyses. It works best when predictors are independent of each other, and when they have a linear relationship to the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\nWhile linear regression is straightforward and easy to understand, it does have some limitations:\n\nIt assumes a linear relationship between input variables and output. If this relationship isn’t linear, linear regression may not provide a good fit to the data.\nIt’s sensitive to outliers. A few extreme data points can significantly skew your regression line.\nIt assumes that all variables are independent of each other. If variables are correlated (known as multicollinearity), it can affect performance."
